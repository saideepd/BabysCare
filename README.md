# Baby's Care

### Objective:
Malnutrition is especially devastating to babies and young children whose brains and bodies depend on good nutrition for their healthy growth and development. And while the damage done is almost always irreversible and reaches far into the future, it is also entirely preventable. By focusing on improving nutrition during the critical first 1,000 days, much of the serious and irreparable damage caused by hunger and malnutrition can be prevented. It can also have a powerful impact on a country’s economy, boosting GDP by as much as 12%.

### Our Approach:
We have developed an Android app where the parents can select from various categories like Nutrition, Treatment, Emergency, Care and get information about how to take proper care, provide nutritious foods, etc. In case of any emergency the parents can even search and contact the nearest Hospital. Also, map is shown to display the nearby hospitals in the Emergency section of the app.
